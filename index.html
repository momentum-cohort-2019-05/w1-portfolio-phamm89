        <h3>Mathematics Teacher</h3>

        <p>
            I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina and moved to Durham, North Carolina in 2005. I attended the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) for my last two years of high school. For undergraduate work, I attended UNC Chapel Hill where I majored in Asian Studies. Upon graduating, I did an internship with Every Nation Campus Ministries at Duke University. In 2013, I returned to UNC Chapel Hill to complete postbaccalaureate work in middle school education for mathematics. From 2015 to the present, I have been a middle school and high school mathematics teacher at Cresset Christian Academy.
